    <h1>Palestine vs Israel Conflict</h1>
    <p>Understanding the History, Causes, and Impact</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>üìú Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
        The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians began in the early 20th century over land disputes and national identity.
        After World War I, the British controlled the region of Palestine. The 1917 Balfour Declaration supported a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, which created tension with the Arab population.
    </p>

    <h2>üóìÔ∏è Key Events</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1948:</strong> Israel declared independence; war broke out, and over 700,000 Palestinians were displaced (Nakba).</li>
        <li><strong>1967:</strong> In the Six-Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.</li>
        <li><strong>1993:</strong> Oslo Accords aimed to create peace and establish a Palestinian state, but efforts collapsed.</li>
        <li><strong>2023‚Äì2024:</strong> Major violence escalated again, especially in Gaza, with heavy casualties and humanitarian crises.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Major Issues</h2>

    <h2>üíî Human Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Thousands of civilians, including women and children, have been killed or injured. Homes, schools, and hospitals are often damaged in airstrikes.
        The humanitarian situation in Gaza is severe, with shortages of food, water, electricity, and medical care.
    </p>

    <h2>üïäÔ∏è Hope for Peace</h2>
    <p>
        Many international organizations and leaders continue to push for a peaceful solution through diplomacy and a two-state solution.
        Dialogue, mutual recognition, and respect for human rights are key to ending the cycle of violence.
